Hello, I recently moved to London from Glasgow. Never been a full-time musician, but I've played in bands constantly since I was about 13 (I'm now 35). I'm looking for paid work in and around London, probably a function band, but I will consider anything. The perfect workload would probably be 3-6 gigs per month but I am adaptable. Available now. I have a car. I have a nice kit. References available on request.

### 2018-2019     Till Death Do Us Party (function band - occasional depping)
